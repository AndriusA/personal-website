    <p>I am a proud co-founder and CTO of the <a href="http://cambridgecoding.com">Cambridge Coding Academy</a>, where we have the ambitious goal of revolutionising Computer Science education: making it smarter, personalised and most importantly - attractive and available to everyone. Because not everyone needs to be a programmer, but everyone does need a bit of Computer Science in their lives today and will need a lot of it tomorrow.</p>

    <p>I am also involved with <a href="http://hubofallthings.org">the HAT</a> project on making the Internet of Things serve you. The Hub of All Things liberates your data from the corporate silos and brings it to you, in your own personal hub where you have complete control over it. My role is to analyse the various data collected by the platform and reshape it into new verticals through data visualisation, to make sense to the users.</p>

    <p>I have recently submitted my PhD dissertation at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge. My PhD was on the Design of Energy-Efficient Mobile Communication Protocols, although I have worked on a wild variety of problems and projects throughout. I was a member of the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/">Networks and Operating Systems group, part of Systems Research Group</a>, working with <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/">Prof. Jon Crowcroft</a> as my advisor. My PhD was partially sponsored by T-Labs, Germany. I also received my BA in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge in 2011.</p>

      <p>In the first summer I initiated the <a href='http://wwww.thinkair.net'>ThinkAir</a> project and implemented its core functionality. The project concerned dynamic code offloading to cloud computing facilities, based on the environmental properties and resource requirements, to improve smartphone performance and battery life. It strongly reinforced my interest in mobile technologies and led to starting a PhD in mobile cloud computing.<br /> During the short period of time in the second summer I took on a few projects that would later blend into my PhD work. The projects were related to mobile cloud computing: cellular infrastructure improvements for more efficient code offloading as well as improving machine-to-machine communication efficiency through virtualization, cloud and code offloading.</p>

I have given lectures on computer operating systems to the Computer Science students in the academy as well as on topics related to identity development to all students. I shared my views and experience with the board to help develop the academy further and most recently I helped to participate in the <a href='http://www.e-volunteering.eu/competition/''>European e-volunteering competition</a>, where we won the second prize.</p>

      <p>I have worked on a variety of small to medium sized web projects over the years. Most of the work I have done was a rather long time ago and I barely have time for such work now. However, I do consider new opportunities if I find the projects interesting. Nevertheless, since I was still in high school when I started, I had the opportunity to learn valuable skills very early: communicating with clients, organising my time very well and working both individually and in small, self-organised teams.</p>
