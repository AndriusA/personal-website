    <p>I am a co-founder and the Head of Engineering at the <a href="http://hubofallthings.com">Hub of All Things (HAT)</a>. The HAT is a personal data store and a multisided platform technology that allows you to see, control and share your personal data. Originally getting involved in the initial research project I was part of the team that formed a spin-off to bring the idea into "the real life". In the team I lead all engineering work on building the ecosystem, ranging across the full stack, cloud infrastructure, third-party resource integration while maintaining the team's flexibility and agility to adjust to business needs while pushing the boundaries of the most bleeding-edge technologies.</p>

    <p>I consider myself both an entrepreneur and an academic. I have earlier co-founder and was the CTO of <a href="http://cambridgecoding.com">Cambridge Coding Academy</a>, an organisation with the ambitious goal of revolutionising Computer Science education. I helped bootstrap the organisation with no external funding into an operational business that delivers value to customers ranging from secondary school kids to software engineering professionals and organisations in the UK and internationally.</p>

    <p>I completed my PhD at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge in March 2016. My PhD was on the Design of Energy-Efficient Mobile Communication Protocols, although I have worked on a wild variety of problems and projects throughout. I was a member of the Networks and Operating Systems group, part of Systems Research Group, working with <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/">Prof. Jon Crowcroft</a> as my advisor. My PhD was partially sponsored by T-Labs, Germany. I also received my BA in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge in 2011.</p>

      <p>In the first summer I initiated the <em>ThinkAir</em> project and implemented its core functionality. The project concerned dynamic code offloading to cloud computing facilities, based on the environmental properties and resource requirements, to improve smartphone performance and battery life. It strongly reinforced my interest in mobile technologies and led to starting a PhD in mobile cloud computing.</p>
<p>During the short period of time in the second summer I took on a few projects that would later blend into my PhD work. The projects were related to mobile cloud computing: cellular infrastructure improvements for more efficient code offloading as well as improving machine-to-machine communication efficiency through virtualization, cloud and code offloading. In both periods, I gained significant experience of working independently and with minimal oversight as I was provided the opportunity of leading the projects and their direction</p>

        This demo presents how phone functionality can be offloaded from a smartphone over wireless link to a PhoneLet by sharing one SIM card across multiple devices. This can lead to significant cost and network load reductions by decreasing the number of simultaneously connected mobile clients. Furthermore, it can save energy for the mobile user when connected to a powered PhoneLet by offloading phone functionality. It absorbs the energy cost of online presence and inefficient mobile applications&#x27; communication patterns, instead providing connectivity for the user over a WiFi link.

        Mobile phones in the 3G/4G era enable us to stay connected not only to the voice network, but also to online services like social networks. In this paper, we study the energy and net- work costs of mobile applications that provide continuous online presence (e.g. WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype). By combining measurements taken on the mobile and the cellular access network, we reveal a detailed picture of the mechanisms selected to implement online presence, along with their effect on handset energy consumption and network signaling traffic. We are surprised to find that simply having idle online presence apps on a mobile (that maintain connectivity in the background, with no user interaction) can drain the handset battery nine times more quickly. This high cost is partly due to online presence apps that are excessively “chatty”, in particular when their design philosophy stems from a similar desktop version. However, we also find that the cost of background app traffic is disproportionately large because of cross-layer interactions in which the traffic unintentionally triggers the promotion of cellular network states. Our experiments show that both of these effects can be overcome with careful implementation. We posit that a two-way push notification system, with messages being sent at a low (regular) frequency and low volume by a network-aware sender, can alleviate many of the costs.

        The popularity of smartphones, cloud computing, and the app store model have led to cellular networks being used in a completely different way than what they were designed for. As a consequence, mobile applications impose new challenges in the design and efficient configuration of constrained networks to maximize application’s performance. Such difficulties are largely caused by the lack of cross-layer understanding of interactions between different entities - applications, devices, the network and its management plane. In this paper, we describe RILAnalyzer, an open-source tool that provides mechanisms to perform network analysis from within a mobile device. RILAnalyzer is capable of recording low-level radio information and accurate cellular net- work control-plane data, as well as user-plane data. We demonstrate how such data can be used to identify previously overlooked issues. Through a small user study across four cellular network providers in two European countries we infer how different network configurations are in reality and explore how such configurations interact with application logic, causing network and energy overheads.

        This demo presents Signposts, a system to provide users with a secure, simple mechanism to establish and maintain communication channels between their personal cloud of named devices. Signpost names exist in the DNSSEC hierarchy, and resolve to secure end-points when accessed by existing DNS clients. Signpost clients intercept user connection intentions while adding privacy and multipath support. Signpost servers co-ordinate clients to dynamically discover routes and overcome the middleboxes that pervade modern edge networks. The demo will show a simple scenario where an individual&#x27;s personal devices (phone, laptop) are interconnected via Signposts while sitting on different networks behind various middleboxes. As a result they will be able to fetch and push data between each other, demonstrated by, e.g., simple web browsing, even as the network configuration changes.

        Today’s mobile phones represent a rich and powerful computing platform, given their sensing, processing and communication capabilities. Phones are also part of the everyday life of billions of people, and therefore represent an exceptionally suitable tool for conducting social and psychological experiments in an unobtrusive way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this paper we illustrate EmotionSense, a mobile sensing platform for social psychology studies based on mobile phones. Key characteristics include the ability of sensing individual emotions as well as activities, verbal and proximity interactions among members of social groups. Moreover, the system is programmable by means of a declarative language that can be used to express adaptive rules to improve power saving. We evaluate a system prototype on Nokia Symbian phones by means of several small-scale experiments aimed at testing performance in terms of accuracy and power consumption. Finally, we present the results of real deployment where we study participants emotions and interactions. We cross-validate our measurements with the results obtained through questionnaires ﬁlled by the users, and the results presented in social psychological studies using traditional methods. In particular, we show how speakers and participants’ emotions can be automatically detected by means of classiﬁers running locally on off-the-shelf mobile phones, and how speaking and interactions can be correlated with activity and location measures.
