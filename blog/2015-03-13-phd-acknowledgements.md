Only when my advisor Prof. Jon Crowcroft gave me the green light to submit my dissertation, I decided that it is time to finally write the acknowledgements part of it... And then I learned that they would be hard to fit on a single page. And didn't - I ended up leaving out a fair bit of people I am grateful to. A lesson learned: remember to thank more often. So I felt it important to share the acknowledgements here as well.

###Acknowledgements

Foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Jon Crowcroft, for his help and guidance, for letting me pursue every line of enquiry I thought worthwhile, for allowing me to share my ideas and learn from others at top conferences, for giving me the opportunity to learn through collaborating with some of the top people in the field, and for always letting me choose my own direction. Jon has helped me become independent and confident enough to strive towards making major contributions after the PhD.

I am grateful to the many people I had the pleasure and privilege of collaborating with during the course of my PhD. Firstly, I am grateful to Pan Hui from T-Labs, who gave me an opportunity to intern with him, which led to me pursuing this PhD. I would also like to thank Deutsche Telekom for their generous financial support. Secondly, I am grateful to my closest collaborator and a great friend, Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, for the heated but fruitful discussions. Thirdly, I would like to thank Dina Papagiannaki and Yan Grunenberger from Telefonica Research for teaching me so much about research and for the fantastic internship which resulted in work that I was able to base a significant portion of this dissertation on. Finally, I am grateful to Cecilia Mascolo and Mirco Musolesi for giving me my first taste of research and for accepting me as a ``pet undergraduate'' to their group -- they are are largely to blame for me wanting to pursue a PhD! Finally, I have met many amazing people outside of the PhD over the last few years, who have helped me in various ways. Special thanks to Lina and Antanas Daniai for all the inspiring and energising meetings. Thank you all.

The biggest thanks goes to my family for their love and support. In particular, I would like to thank my mother for always being there for me and teaching me to make my own decisions, my sister for always setting the standard I had to live up to, and my wonderful Aiste for standing by me through all my career pursuits, even when disruptive and inconvenient. This work is dedicated to them.
