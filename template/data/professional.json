The project concerned dynamic code offloading to cloud computing facilities, based on the environmental properties and resource requirements, to improve smartphone performance and battery life. It strongly reinforced my interest in mobile technologies and led to starting a PhD in mobile cloud computing.\n\nDuring the short period of time in the second summer I took on a few projects that would later blend into my PhD work. The projects were related to mobile cloud computing: cellular infrastructure improvements for more efficient code offloading as well as improving machine-to-machine communication efficiency through virtualization, cloud and code offloading. In both periods, I gained significant experience of working independently and with minimal oversight as I was provided the opportunity of leading the projects and their direction"
